BMIN5030 Final Project
Project Title:
Effectiveness of AI-Based Models in Predicting Patient Mortality Outcomes

Description:
This project explores the effectiveness of AI-based models in predicting patient mortality outcomes compared to traditional clinical methods. It analyzes patient data from the MIMIC-IV database and evaluates the accuracy and potential benefits of AI in healthcare.

Objectives:
To assess the predictive accuracy of AI-based models for patient outcomes such as ICU readmissions or mortality.
To compare AI-based predictions with traditional clinical prediction methods.
To identify key factors influencing prediction accuracy.

Dataset:
Source - MIMIC-IV database

Description:
Contains de-identified health-related data associated with critical care unit patients.

Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language - R
IDE - RStudio
Libraries - 
  tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization,
  caret for model training, 
  randomForest for AI-based predictions, 
  survival for survival analysis

Repository Structure:
  data/: Contains preprocessed datasets used for modeling and analysis, 
  scripts/: R scripts for data processing, modeling, and analysis, 
  results/: Outputs, including model results and visualizations, 
  docs/: Project documentation and presentation files, 
  README.md: Project overview (this file).

Results: 
The analysis demonstrates [briefly describe key findings].
Insights into the potential benefits of AI-based predictions in clinical settings are highlighted.

Limitations: 
The project is limited to the scope of the MIMIC-IV dataset.
Computational constraints may affect model training and evaluation.

Future Work: 
  Extend the analysis to other patient outcomes.
  Integrate additional datasets to improve model generalizability.
  Compare other AI techniques for prediction accuracy.
